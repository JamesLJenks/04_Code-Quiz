# 04_Code-Quiz
## Description

For this project, the goal was to build a JavaScript coding assessment application to test the knowledge of coding boot camp students in preparation for future developer interviews. For the quiz, users are given 60 seconds to answer five multiple-choice questions. For each wrong answer, ten seconds is subtracted from the time. Once the assessment is completed or time runs out, the remaining time represents the user's score. This project was an opportunity for our class to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a dynamic, interactive web page.
